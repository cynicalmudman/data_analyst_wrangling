    "# WeRateDogs Wrangling Report\n",
    "This document sets out the steps taken to gather, assess, and clean the data relating to the WeRateDogs Twitter account in preparation for analysis.  \n",
    "## Gathering\n",
    "First we gathered the date from three different sources:  \n",
    "\n",
    "1) The WeRateDogs Twitter archive, which was a file on hand,  \n",
    "2) The classification of the dogs in the photos. For each tweet there is a photo of the dog being rated and this was run by another team through a machine learning algorithm to try to work out the particulary breed. This was downloaded programmatically from a url.  \n",
    "3) Extra data from the Twitter API. Ideally this would have been done directly but I wasn't able to get access so used the data provided.  \n",
    "\n",
    "## Assessing\n",
    "The data was loaded into dataframes using the pandas library. Various techniques were then used on the three data sources to detect any missing or incorrect data and to ensure the data is tidy.\n",
    "\n",
    "The key findings were:\n",
    "- ratings needed to be cleaned up as the technique for pulling them from the tweets wasn't perfect and seemed to rely on finding a \"/\"\n",
    "- ratings were sometimes for multiple dogs, e.g. 110/100 for ten dogs in a picture\n",
    "- the breed data was badly organised and contained many images where something other than a dog had been identified\n",
    "\n",
    "The full list of issues is below."

    "- Retweets and replies were dropped since there are not simple ratings of a picture of a dog\n",
    "- Ratings were corrected where something other than a rating was picked up\n",
    "- Ratings for multiple dogs were normailsed to that of a single dog by dividing by the number of dogs\n",
